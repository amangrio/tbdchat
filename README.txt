Client Features:
    - Login
        Prompt between primary execution loop and server connect can handle a users login
      
    - Register
        Prompt between primary execution loop and server connect can handle new user registration
      
    - xyz
        etc
      
Server Features:
    - Register
        Allows a single registration for any given unique username (verify)
        Would like to implement a file to store all usernames between server runs
     
Known Bugs / Errors:
    - Client - Goes into infinite loop if invalid input (only for non-numerical)
      entered at Login/Register prompt
      
    - Client - Does not print out correct alias for messages sent by him/her self
      
    - Server - Can have a conversation between the same user logged in two times
      
    - General - Fix message colors to differentiate between each client
      
    - General - Would like to add
